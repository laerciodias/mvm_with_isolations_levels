The files .db are the outcome of the simulation.
If I want to continue the simulation I must copy the .db file to the cluster, run my simulations, check the integrity of the file/results, and replace the copy keeped here.


The files __MXU.csv are the calcutaions of physical quantities (MXU - symbols for manetization (M), susceptibility (X), and Binder cumulant (U)) based on the .db.
If I runned more simulations cycles, I must update the .csv file using DROPBOX/2017-voterModel/code/resultados_GIT/toolkit/calc_physical_quantities.ipynb
