The following steps should be used to analyze, for example, the simulation results for one value of the visibility parameter.

BASIC PLOTS
- Produce plots for magnetization, susceptibility and binder cumulant. They will show if there is or not a critical point q_c. 
- Test the M ~ L^-1 scale for q >> q_c.

CRITICAL POINT q_c
- Do the calculation of critical point q_c and show a plot.

CRITICAL EXPONENTS
- Do the estimation of the critical exponents using q_c. See plots to check how good are the fittings at the exponents' estimation. Check the data collapse to evaluate the estimation quality.
