    '''
    Calculate numerical derivatives, using interpolation to improve results.
    
    Parameters:
    - num_multiply: if x is an array with n points, this funcion will return an array with aproximately n*num_multiply points.
                    To have more points is crucial to improving the accuracy of the interpolation.
                    
    Returns an expanded version of x, X, and the corresponding values of the derivative, dY.
    X and dY are numpy arrays.
    
    NOTE: This function will be not so good at the extremes of the interval, particularly for hard functions like oscillating functions.
