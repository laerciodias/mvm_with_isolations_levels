To add functionalities (here or at toolkit folder):

1. Work your functionality out of the control version up to decide the name of it.
2. Once the name is decided, add to master branch an empty version of the new functionality and create a dev branch for developing and testing.
3. After a successfull dev/test/commit in the dev branch, merge the functionality without the tests artefacts (these must be commited on the dev branch).
    Steps to merge:
        - git checkout master
        - git checkout dev_<functionality> <functionality path filename>
        - remove the parameters settings and tests from the notebook.
        - git add <functionality path filename>
        - git commit -m "Message"
