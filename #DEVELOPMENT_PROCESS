To add (or change) functionalities (here or at toolkit folder):


    1. Check out the development branch from the last END POINT of a development cycle commit.

    2. Develop (or change) your functionality.

    3. Test your functionality.

    4. After tests passed, commit the functionality and the tests to the development branch.

    5. Check out the master branch.

    6. Get (or merge) the functionality from the development branch. AS A RULE, in the master branch, the notebooks have no cels with an output. You should prepare the notebook before committing it to the master branch.
    
        6.1 To get a file from development branch use:
    
                $ git checkout development <file>
    
        6.2 To merge from development branch:
        
                $ git merge --no-commit development
        
            For sure, you will need to solve conflicts! Good luck!
